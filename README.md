# The List

## Sharing Data With Interrupts

### Background

Currently, it is not convenient to share non-atomic or non-`Sync` data with an interrupt using safe Rust. Because interrupt handlers are functions that take no arguments, all data consumed by interrupts must either be global or module scoped Atomics (e.g. `AtomicBool`), local `static` variables, or global or module scoped `static` variables.

Global variables are not great in Rust, because:

* All mutable access (of non-`Sync`/`Atomic` data) must be `unsafe`
* Not all data can be initialized in a `const` context, so it's often necessary to use an `Option<T>` to delay the initialization to runtime
* Global variables aren't typically idiomatic Rust.

Frameworks like [cortex-m-rtic] achieve this in a zero cost fashion by using a Domain Specific Language to automatically provide safe access to shared resources between tasks and interrupts, however these tools can not be used by applications not using RTIC, or by libraries such as HAL or BSP crates.

[bare-metal#15]: https://github.com/japaric/bare-metal/pull/15
[cortex-m-rtic]: https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic

### Success Criteria

Ideally, we would be able to support all of the following use cases:

1. Sharing a variable between the main thread and only one interrupt handler
2. Sharing a variable between the main thread and one or more interrupt handlers
3. Moving a variable from the main thread to one interrupt handler

We should be able to serve the three use cases listed above, while:

* Using only safe Rust (at least as a user of the library)
* Add only minimal overhead, if not "zero cost"

## Serialization/Deserialization in `no_std`

### Background

For embedded systems that send or receive data to other devices, or who read/write data to a medium such as an SD card or other Flash memory, it is useful to have automatic serialization and deserialization support to turn structured data into a binary format.

While tools like [`serde`] are widely used in Rust (and already support `no_std`), few of the the backends (like [`serde_json`]) are supported in a `no_std` environment.

[`serde`]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde
[`serde_json`]: https://github.com/serde-rs/json
[`ssmarshal`]: https://gitlab.com/robigalia/ssmarshal
[`ujson`]: https://github.com/japaric/jnet/tree/master/ujson
[`bincode-no-std`]: https://github.com/losfair/bincode
[`cbor-no-std`]: https://crates.io/crates/cbor-no-std

### Success Criteria

We should be able to serialize and deserialize data in an automatic way, either using a frontend like [`serde`], or with a simple and convenient `serialize` and `deserialize` method. To use these, we should not need heap allocations, and it should be possible to detect when serialization and deserialization have failed.

Additionally, all common datatypes used in embedded Rust should be supported, as well as a (preferrably automatic) way to add support for custom data types. Common data types include:

* Fixed point signed/unsigned numbers like `u8..u64` or `i8..i64`
* Floating point numbers like `f32..f64`
* Booleans
* Variable length types, like `[u8]` and `&str`
* Tuples
* Enumerated types

We should also have support for different ways of serializing data, primarily:

* Self-describing schemas, such as JSON or CBOR
* Non-self-describing schemas, such as binary packed data or ProtoBufs

### Work in progress

* [`serde`] already has support for `no_std` environments, when using a feature flag
    * Serde welcomes [contributions](https://github.com/serde-rs/json/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [`ssmarshal`] has support for basic types, but does not support enums with more than 255 variants, or variable sized types like slices. This covers only the non-self-describing use case.
    * ssmarshal welcomes [contributions](https://gitlab.com/robigalia/ssmarshal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [`ujson`] supports JSON serialization and deserialization for `no_std` environments, but is experimental (and not on crates.io), and is unlikely to be stabilized as-is
    * It is unknown if ujson welcomes contributions
* There are a number of forks of `std`-only `serde` backends, though they do not seem to have official support from the upstream libraries. These forks include:
    * [`bincode-no-std`]
    * [`cbor-no-std`]

## Support crates for USB Host and USB Device Support

### Background

The USB standard has a fair bit of commonality between USB Devices (like Mice, Printers, and Webcams) and USB Hosts (like Laptops and Raspberry Pis), but each specific microcontroller has a slightly different implementation of the USB Controller at the bottom of the stack. It would make bringing up a USB stack on a new chip much easier if there was a `#[no_std]` crate which defined some common traits, enumerations and structures at the bottom, and then provided support for various device classes above that.

### Success Criteria

I'd like to be able to implement USB Host and USB Device support on the Texas Instruments Tiva-C line and the STM32F4 line by only implementing a thin shim around each device's USB OTG Controller registers. The USB Host should be able to handle a USB Keyboard and the USB Device should enumerate as a Communications Class Device (two of the most common use-cases).

### Work in progress

* The [tm4c123x-hal](https://crates.io/crates/tm4c123x-hal) crate has svd2rust definitions for the USB controller's registers.
* There is a [branch](https://github.com/thejpster/tm4c-hal/tree/usb_host_support/tm4c123x-hal) looking at adding USB Host support.
* [usb-device](https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device) crate and corresponding device-specific implementations for STM32:
  * [stm32-usbd](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-usbd) (USBFS peripheral in F0, F1, F3, L0, L4 families)
  * [synopsys-usb-otg](https://github.com/stm32-rs/synopsys-usb-otg) (OTG peripheral in F1, F4, F7, H7 families)
* [usbd-serial](https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usbd-serial) crate implements USB CDC for serial communication.
* [usbd-hid](https://github.com/twitchyliquid64/usbd-hid) crate implements USB HID, providing a way to implement
keyboard and mouse drivers on top of it.
* [usbd-human-interface-device](https://github.com/dlkj/usbd-human-interface-device) crate implements various keyboards, mice and consumer control devices on top of `usb-device`
* [Keyberon](https://github.com/TeXitoi/keyberon) project uses `usb-device` to implement its own HID support for USB keyboard firmware.
This project usually serves as a starting point for those willing to implement their own USB keyboard firmware.

## Display and GUI support

### Background

So far there seem to be no libraries to do anything with displays or gui's. However in C some libraries have already been written. Rust could interface with these libraries if bindings were made.

#### Useful links
* https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen to help out making bindings
* [LittlevGL](https://github.com/littlevgl/lvgl), an Open-source Embedded GUI Library written in C.
* [GuiLite](https://github.com/idea4good/GuiLite), a small GUI library of 5000 lines of C++ code that runs on all platforms, including MCU's.

### Success Criteria

Bindings to C libraries or a Rust library that is meant for Displays and/or GUIs.

### Work in progress
* [Rafael Car√≠cio](https://github.com/rafaelcaricio) is working on [lvgl-rs](https://github.com/rafaelcaricio/lvgl-rs), which are safe bindings for Rust to use LittlevGL ([see also the annoucement on the LVGL forums](https://forum.lvgl.io/t/rust-bindings-for-littlevgl/2386)). LVGL can now also [compile to WASM](https://github.com/rafaelcaricio/lvgl-rs-wasm) thanks to Rust.

## Support for no_std esp32-cam 

### Background

There is a large amount of accessible libraries and projects involving the esp32-cam in c++, and a few projects for rust using esp-idf-std (listed below), however there are no no_std crates with this support.
A repository of information, including pin defintions, can be found (here)[[https://github.com/raphaelbs/esp32-cam-ai-thinker/blob/master/docs/esp32cam-pin-notes.md](https://github.com/raphaelbs/esp32-cam-ai-thinker/tree/master)].

### Success Criteria

A library with bindings to the esp32-cam camera, accessible in a no_std environment.

### Work in progress

* The [ChenHuaYou/esp-cam-rs](https://github.com/ChenHuaYou/esp-cam-rs) and [Jlocash/esp-camera-rs](https://github.com/jlocash/esp-camera-rs) repositories support esp32-cam using esp-idf-std bindings.

### Success Criteria

I'd like to be able to Foo using **only** a Bib, Bim, or Bap.

### Work in progress

* The [foobar](https://crates.io/crates/foobar) crate has [Issue #1337](#) open to add support for Foo-ing with a Bim or Bap.
    * The `foobar` crate is on [on github](#)
